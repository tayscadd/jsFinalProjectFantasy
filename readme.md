**How To Run**
- Run: npm install
- Run: node server.js
- Go to [http://localhost:5500/](http://localhost:5500/) (can be changed in server.js to a different port, and shouldn't break anything if you do.)

***<u>Assignment Requirements</u>***

- *15 requirements completed and working:* All 15 requirements I had on my proposal are completed and working.
- *Must have an API Server:* I do, and all four CRUD endpoints are used. They can be found in client-server-communications and server.js
- *Vanilla JS on the Frontend:* Vanilla JS throughout.
- *Well designed:* Honestly I think it's the best thing I've ever designed!
- *At least 5 commits per week:* I didn't do too well on this one. I forgot to make commits when I really started about two weeks ago, and I scrapped it all and restarted last week so it didn't even matter.
